# Housing Price Prediction: MLflow Tracking and Deployment on AWS

This directory contains and example project built entirely on AWS:

- Used AWS services: CodeCommit, Sagemaker (ML), EC2 (MLflow) and S3 (storage).
- Problem/dataset: [House price prediction (regression)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

For more information, check the `README.md` file in [mxagar/mlflow_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/mlflow_guide), specifically [**15. AWS Integration with MLflow**](https://github.com/mxagar/mlflow_guide#15-aws-integration-with-mlflow).

**To structure the guide, I followed the course [MLflow in Action - Master the art of MLOps using MLflow tool](https://www.udemy.com/course/mlflow-course), created by J Garg and published on Udemy.**
