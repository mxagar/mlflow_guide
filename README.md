# MLflow

These are my personal notes on how to use MLflow, compiled after following courses and tutorials, as well as making personal experiences.

**The main course I followed to structure the guide is [MLflow in Action - Master the art of MLOps using MLflow tool](https://www.udemy.com/course/mlflow-course), created by J Garg and published on Udemy.**

In addition to the current repository, you might be interested in my notes on the Udacity ML DevOps Nanodegree, which briefly introduces MLflow, [mlops_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/mlops_udacity):
